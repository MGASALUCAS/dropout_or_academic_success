# dropout_or_academic_success
Here it's a machine Learning model to predict dropout or academic success of students.

So, you wanna be Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg?

Let's see what Data says, after all Data speaks the truth( almost always!)
The dataset was created in a project that aims to contribute to the reduction of academic dropout and failure in higher education, 
by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. 
The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment – academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors. 
The problem is formulated as a three category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course.
